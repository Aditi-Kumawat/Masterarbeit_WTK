## Abstract
Geothermal energy is a renewable resource that currently draws significant attention in
Germany. However, its side effect, geothermally induced earthquakes, must be considered
when planning a power plant near residential areas. In the thesis, two questions are answered.
First, will those earthquakes damage the building or make residents uncomfortable? Second,
what is the predominant seismic parameter causing the negative effect on the structures and
residents?

The following approaches are proposed to answer these two questions. First, a scenariobased
ground motion generator is introduced that models the seismic event in the Insheim
area, Germany. This generator can generate representative ground motion with stochasticity
using seismic parameters such as moment magnitude and rupture distance. Once the
generator is built, the responses of the structure excited by the ground motion are simulated
and evaluated. Second, when performing serviceability and comfortability analysis, a
large number of simulations are usually required, which will be highly time-consuming. To
accelerate the assessment, a surrogate model, Stochastic Polynomial Chaos Expansion, is
utilized. This surrogate model can efficiently re-interpret the relationship between inputted
seismic parameters and outputted response, including the systemâ€™s stochasticity.

Finally, the significance of each input seismic parameter will be analyzed using global sensitivity
analysis, and the potential damage and adverse effects on residents will be evaluated
using serviceability and comfortability analysis.
