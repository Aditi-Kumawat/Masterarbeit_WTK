## SCPE 
SPCE is a non-intrusive parametric probability based surrogate model. Please check:

for detailed implementation of SPCE algorithm.

## Train model and prediction
To train the model, one has to prepare three parts, which are:

1. [Input datasets, X](./InputData/)
2. [Their corresponding realization, Y](./InputData/Realization/)
3. [Configuration file](./config/)

Please check the [example](./Example.ipynb) for detailed implementation.
